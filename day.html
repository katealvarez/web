    <h2>Day</h2>
    <p>The song "Nights," begins with a description of someone from Frank Ocean's past, perhaps a past lover or a past version of himself. Either way, this other entity is someone that Frank is trying to escape when he says "If I get my money right // You know I won't need you." It's also clear that Frank is under extreme stress through the fast-paced beat, continuous lyrics, and repeating of words, as one feels when they're <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/sleep-deprivation-stages#recovery">sleep deprived</a>. However, as the song nears its transition, we see Frank give in to short-term relief saying "rolling marijuana, thats a cheap vacation," and at his lowest point, lets in this past entity back into his life when he says "I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside." </p>
