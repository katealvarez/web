    <h2>Day</h2>
    <p>The song "Nights," begins with a description of someone from Frank Ocean's past, perhaps a past lover or a past version of himself. This other entity is someone that Frank is trying to escape when he says</p>
    <p id="quote">If I get my money right</p>
    <p id="quote">You know I won't need you.</p>
    <p>It's also clear that Frank is under extreme stress through the fast-paced beat, continuous lyrics, and repeating of words, as one feels when they're <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/sleep-deprivation-stages#recovery">sleep deprived</a>. Ocean's sleep deprivation sparks from working a night shift and taking care of a baby, reflecting stressful periods he has lived in his life that make him relatable to his audience. However, as the song nears its transition, we see Frank give in to short-term relief saying</p>
    <p id="quote">rolling marijuana, thats a cheap vacation.</p>
    <p>At his lowest point, lets in this past entity back into his life when he says</p>
    <p id="quote">I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside.</p>
    <p>To summarize, the beginning portion of the song "Nights" describes Frank Ocean ending his stressful day, becoming more and more miserable as the day drags out into night.</p>
