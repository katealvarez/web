        <h3>what is hello to myself?</h3>
        <p>hello to myself is a program that allows the user to learn more about themselves according to the rules of astrology.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>how do i use it?</h3>
        <p>To use Hello to Myself, first run the program. When prompted, enter your date of birth using the format (MM/DD). The program will present your zodiac sign, an image of your zodiac sign’s constellation, and a graph of your strengths and weaknesses according to your zodiac sign. After, the program will ask you if you would like some affirmations. Affirmations are statements that one can speak, write down, or say in their head to bring positive energy throughout their day. After answering the yes or no question, the project is complete!</p>
      </li>

        <h3>how does it work?</h3>
        <p>The project works by using a series of input functions, then manipulating the input as parameters for other functions that consist of various if/elif/else statements to find the correct zodiac sign and corresponding data. The constellation image is formed using the python turtle library and a series of statements that direct the turtle to move in the desired direction. The bar graph is formed using the python matplot library, and the affirmations are formed using a separate text file, which is then manipulated to present the correct affirmations with their respective zodiac signs in an organized fashion.</p>
