		<h1>Why the song "Nights" by Frank Ocean is so good.</h1>

    <h2>Night</h2>
    <p>The second part of "Nights" is much more raw and slow-paced than the first, paralleling the feeling of serenity and calm in the middle of the night. The song has transitioned from a hectic day and swtiched to a tranquil, comforting night, which Frank is now taking advantage of. In this part, Frank also takes the time to reminisce in the past, specifically the past entitity he tried to escape. This is evident when he says "After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus // Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited // Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address." "'Trina" refers to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Hurricane-Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, which left Frank homeless and forced to stay with the antagonist of the song. But the nostalgia is short-lived, consisting of less than half as many lines as the metaphorical day. Sadly, Frank's reminiscence is quickly overtaken by thoughts of his next work shift. Thus the song "Nights" is only a fraction of the endless cycle of working, burnout, quick satisfaction, and working again, a reality for many people.</p>
