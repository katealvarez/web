        <p>This is a website describing why I believe the song "Nights" by Frank Ocean is so good. Frank Ocean is an American singer-songwriter known for his R&B/jazz/rap style. His discography includes </p>
        <ul id="discography">
          <li>Nostalgia, Ultra (2011)</li>
          <li>Channel Orange (2012)</li>
          <li>Endless (2016)</li>
          <li>Blonde (2016)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The song "Nights" is the 9th song of his latest album, Blonde. The different spelling of blonde/blond on the album title and the album cover (picured to the right) was done purposefully to represent the duality of masculinity and femininty present throughout the album. There are multitudes of symbols like this hidden within Frank's music. The song "Nights" is one such example that will be discussed in this site.</p>
