		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>If you haven't already, I strongly recommend listening to the song "Nights" by Frank Ocean by clicking <a href="https://youtu.be/r4l9bFqgMaQ">here</a>.</p>
			
		<h2>Day</h2>
		<p>The song "Nights," begins with a description of someone from Frank Ocean's past, perhaps a past lover or a past version of himself. Either way, this other entity is someone that Frank is trying to escape when he says "If I get my money right // You know I won't need you." It's also clear that Frank is under extreme stress through the fast-paced beat, continuous lyrics, and repeating of words, as one feels when they're <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/sleep-deprivation-stages#recovery">sleep deprived</a>. However, as the song nears its transition, we see Frank give in to short-term relief saying "rolling marijuana, thats a cheap vacation," and at his lowest point, lets in this past entity back into his life when he says "I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside." </p>
      
		<h2>Sunset</h2>
		<p>The beat switch in "Nights" to most listeners is viewed as the star (no pun intended) of the song, if not of the entire album, and for good reason! The beat switch occurs at the exact middle point of the album <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzoqV_VvWIwGzYTcm3r1JwqgQOBXTvKyd">Blonde</a>, signifying a turning point in both the song and the album. The beat switch symbolizes the switch from day to night, or, the sunset. The chaos before the beat switch is juxtaposed with the melodic smoothness that succeeds it. The distorted sounds of the guitar create rapid imagery in a listener's mind. In my head, I picture a small ball ricocheting off of the sides of a small room. When the song changes the beat so quickly and to such a different sound, it creates an incredibly satisfying, chilling emotion that sets it apart from a typical contemporary song. The ball is now gliding acoss the room like ice skates on ice. These mind-bending beat switches are a signature of Frank Ocean.</p>
      
		<h2>Night</h2>
		<p>The second part of "Nights" is much more raw and slow-paced than the first, paralleling the feeling of serenity and calm in the middle of the night. The song has transitioned from a hectic day and swtiched to a tranquil, comforting night, which Frank is now taking advantage of. In this part, Frank also takes the time to reminisce in the past, specifically the past entitity he tried to escape. This is evident when he says "After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus // Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited // Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address." "'Trina" refers to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Hurricane-Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, which left Frank homeless and forced to stay with the antagonist of the song. But the nostalgia is short-lived, consisting of less than half as many lines as the metaphorical day. Sadly, Frank's reminiscence is quickly overtaken by thoughts of his next work shift. Thus the song "Nights" is only a fraction of the endless cycle of working, burnout, quick satisfaction, and working again, a reality for many people.</p>
