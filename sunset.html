    <h2>Sunset</h2>
    <p>The beat switch in "Nights" to most listeners is viewed as the star (no pun intended) of the song, if not of the entire album, and for good reason! The beat switch occurs at the exact middle point of the album <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzoqV_VvWIwGzYTcm3r1JwqgQOBXTvKyd">Blonde</a>, signifying a turning point in both the song and the album. The beat switch symbolizes the switch from day to night, or, the sunset. The chaos before the beat switch is juxtaposed with the melodic smoothness that succeeds it. The distorted sounds of the guitar create rapid imagery in a listener's mind. In my head, I picture a small ball ricocheting off of the sides of a small room. When the song changes the beat so quickly and to such a different sound, it creates an incredibly satisfying, chilling emotion that sets it apart from a typical contemporary song. The ball is now gliding acoss the room like ice skates on ice. These mind-bending beat switches are a signature of Frank Ocean.</p>
