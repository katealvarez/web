    <h2>Sunset</h2>
    <p>I titled this portion of the website "Sunset" to symbolize the beat switch that transitions the "Day" to the "Night" sections of the song. The beat switch in "Nights" to most listeners is viewed as the star (no pun intended) of the song. The beat switch also occurs at the exact middle point of the album <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzoqV_VvWIwGzYTcm3r1JwqgQOBXTvKyd">Blonde</a>, signifying a turning point in both the song and the album. Beat switches are a signature of Frank Ocean. They incite a "chilling" or a satisfying feeling in the listener as the chaos before the beat switch is juxtaposed with the melodic smoothness that succeeds it. The beat switch is preceded by distorted sounds of electric guitar that create rapid imagery in a listener's mind. They signify the chaos and anxiety ongoing in Ocean's mind as he approaches the end of the day and the start of a new one. The distortion rapidly to the light sounds of piano almost like a euphoric release. The release can be interpreted as consuming a drug, a frequent theme in his music, or falling asleep. Either way, Frank's previous anxieties no longer trouble him when he focuses on the present, saying</p>
    <p id="quote">Every night f***** every day up</p>
    <p id="quote">Every day patches the night up</p>
    <p>Now, Frank is resentful of the end of the day and is patiently waiting for the dawn of a new one to patch his night up.</p>
